# Background  
This will be where I take notes for the `Introduction to Statistical Learning` book. I will mainly be using this as a place to put my code for the practice problems, however I hope to also take some legimiate notes that I can use in the future for access,. 

I also hope to evetually delve into `Elements of Statistical Learning`, however I need a bit of a review of linear algebra for that one to be solid.   


## Uses  
I'm hoping that I can do at least one chapter of reading per week including exercises. Exercises and labs will be done in an Rmarkdwon folder. If extra time or interest, I may delve into some Shipt stuff as well, but I'll have to exclude that from the repository since that's sensitive stuff.  

## Extra Mile  
* Do exercises using Python code since predominantly a python user at work. 


## I'll update as I go
