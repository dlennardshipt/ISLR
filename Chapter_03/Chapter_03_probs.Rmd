### Playing Around with Advertising Data  
```{r advertising}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
# load advertising data 
df <- read.csv("http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv")
df_long <- df %>% gather(key='source', value='spend', 
                         c("TV", 'radio', 'newspaper'))

#Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
ggplot(aes(x=spend, y=sales), data=df_long)+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~source, scales='free_x')
# first glimpse, newspaper budget doesn't seem to have much, and radio seems to have a boundary. TV has clearest relationship. however, newspaper seems correlated with good sales still 

#How strong is relationship between ad budget and sales 
unique_fields =  names(df)
cor_list = list()
for (i in unique_fields[1:3]){
  cor_list[[i]] = cor.test(df[[i]], df[['sales']])
}
print(cor_list)
# strong correlation between TV and decent with radio, weak linear cor 
# between newspaper budget and sales. 


# simple linear regression  
summary(lm(sales ~ TV,data=df))
ggplot(aes(x=TV, y=sales), data=df)+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm',formula=y~x)

```
